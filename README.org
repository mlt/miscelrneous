#+Title: Some R stuff I use
#+Author: Mikhail Titov

* Intro

There is no that much special stuff just something I find useful myself. Notably there are 3 main features so far.

** tmdl (a package to facilitate TMDL studies)

This is migrated from [[tmdl.r-forge.r-project.org][r-forge]].

# It also has some handy functions for /lattice/.

** miscelrneous

*** Corrected Lomb-Scargle periodogra

A [[https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2009-June/201949.html][typo]][fn:::This is corrected now
in /cts/] fixed in /cts::spec.ls/ implementation. Also normalization
is performed to satisfy Parseval's theorem, i.e. to match total
variance in the signal.

*** USGS water data

A couple of handy function

- url.make.USGS
- read.rdb.USGS

to fetch data from [[http://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis][National Water Information System]] @ USGS
